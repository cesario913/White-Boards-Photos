> [!warning]
> This project is very much a WIP but there is an MVP (minimum viable product).

> The software side will be my next priority,
> for now i am using an example sketch for the esp32 cam (server) that allows to take and save photos over local wi-fi.

# Objectives

The goal of this project is to have an object that makes it easy for you to take pictures of what's on your whiteboard, be able to do this trough a physical button or over wi-fi, and have a SVG file stored in the cloud (ex. google drive) i would also like to have the possibility of choosing it as video input for discord, zoom etc.


Solutions to this problem already exist like the [logitech scribe](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/video-conferencing/room-solutions/scribe.960-001332.html) but i want to have my take on it and make it a lot more afordable.

1. Print every STL in PLA 20 % fill

2. Install esp32 cam server example onto the esp32, solder the usb type C and change the anntena to be external  

3. Apply the double sided tape to the backside of "fixation mur" and fix it to the wall in the correct orientation

4. Thread the M5 x 30 mm bolt in "avant bras" and assemble it with "biceps"

5. Pass your USB type C trough "fixation mur" first and then trough "biceps" & "avant bras"  and bolt them together with M ??

6. Connect the camera module to the rest and connect the cable
